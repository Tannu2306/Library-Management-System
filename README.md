# Library Management System 📚

A Python-based Library Management System designed to manage and organize books, members, and transactions in a library. This system simplifies tasks like adding books, issuing books to members, returning books, and tracking available inventory.

## Features ✨
- **Book Management**: Add, update, delete, and view books in the library.
- **Issue Books**: Issue books to members and track due dates.
- **Return Books**: Manage book returns and update inventory.
- **Data Persistence**: Save and load data using files (e.g., CSV, JSON, or a database).
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Command-line or GUI-based interface for easy interaction.

## Technologies Used 💻
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Database**: SQLite, MySQL, or file-based storage (CSV/JSON)
- **Libraries/Frameworks**: 
  - `tkinter` (for GUI, if applicable)
  - `sqlite3` or `mysql-connector` (for database integration)
  - `pandas` (for data manipulation, optional)

## How It Works 🛠️
1. **Add Books**: Enter book details like title, author, ISBN, and quantity.
3. **Issue Books**: Assign books to members and set a due date for return.
4. **Return Books**: Mark books as returned and update the inventory.
5. **Search**: Find books or members by their name, ID, or other attributes.
6. **View Reports**: Generate reports for available books, issued books, and member details.


## Future Enhancements 🚀
- Integrate a GUI using `tkinter` or `PyQt`.
- Add email notifications for overdue books.
- Implement user authentication for librarians and members.
- Expand the database to include categories, genres, and more.
